### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm an analytics and data engineer.

- Iâ€™m currently working on an attention mechanism based on a recursive Bayesian estimator implemented in PyTorch as part of an MSc capstone project

- I'm currently reading [Operationalizing Machine Learning: An Interview Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09125) (see also an [interview with one of the co-first authors](https://podtail.com/podcast/gradient-dissent-weights-biases/shreya-shankar-operationalizing-machine-learning/) on Gradient Dissent), and [In-Home Activity Recognition: Bayesian Inference for Hidden Markov Models](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6850239?arnumber=6850239).

- In past work I've enjoyed building out quality control systems with things like machine learning-driven anomaly detection, modular templated communications, and video/text classification
