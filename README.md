### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Quality Analyst.

- Iâ€™m currently working on an attention mechanism based on a recursive Bayesian estimator implemented in PyTorch as part of an MSc capstone project

- I'm currently reading [Adaptive Risk Minimization: A Meta-Learning Approach for Tackling Group Distribution Shift](https://openreview.net/forum?id=MA8eT-vUPvZ), and [Operationalizing Machine Learning: An Interview Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09125) (see also an [interview with one of the co-first authors](https://podtail.com/podcast/gradient-dissent-weights-biases/shreya-shankar-operationalizing-machine-learning/) on Gradient Dissent).

- In past work I've enjoyed building out quality control systems with things like machine learning-driven anomaly detection, modular templated communications, and video/text classification
