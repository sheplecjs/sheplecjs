### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm an analytics and data engineer.

- Iâ€™m currently working on an attention mechanism based on a recursive Bayesian estimator implemented in PyTorch as part of an MSc capstone project

- Iâ€™m currently learning about making a terminal gui in rust when I need a change of pace

- I'm currently reading the [GPT-4 System Card](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/gpt-4-system-card.pdf), [Operationalizing Machine Learning: An Interview Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09125), and a historical piece that's somehow **more** terrifying - [The Devil in the White City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil_in_the_White_City).

- In past work I've enjoyed building out quality control systems with things like machine learning-driven anomaly detection, modular templated communications, and video/text classification
