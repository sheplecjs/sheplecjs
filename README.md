### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Quality Analyst.

- Iâ€™m currently working on a system for automated integration testing of source systems to validate and reconcile front end interaction with data assets that land in a data lake

- In past work I've enjoyed building out quality control systems with things like machine learning-driven anomaly detection, modular templated communications, and video/text classification

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: there's an email available on my profile site linked in profile details
