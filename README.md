### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Quality Analyst.

- Iâ€™m currently working on adding dynamic templating in our custom orchestration solution and a frontend for users to customize integrity and timeliness checks on critical data.

- In past work I've enjoyed building out quality control systems with things like machine learning-driven anomaly detection, modular templated communications, and video/text classification
