### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm an analytics and data engineer, recently relocated in the UK.

- Iâ€™m currently working on an attention mechanism based on a recursive Bayesian estimator implemented in PyTorch as part of an MSc capstone project

- Iâ€™m currently learning about making a terminal gui in rust when I need a change of pace

- In past work I've enjoyed building out quality control systems with things like machine learning-driven anomaly detection, modular templated communications, and video/text classification

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: there's an email account available on my profile site linked in profile details
